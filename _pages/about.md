Hello! Welcome to my homepage!

I am a PhD scholar in the Department of Mathematics at the [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT Delhi)](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/people/phd/current), working under the supervision of [Dr. Prahllad Deb](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/prahllad). I joined IIIT Delhi after receiving the prestigious **INSPIRE Research Fellowship** from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.

My primary research interests lie in **functional analysis**, particularly the **Cowen-Douglas class of operators**, with connections to **complex analysis** and **non-commutative function theory**. In addition, I am interested in:

- **[Differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry)** â€” the study of smooth manifolds and geometric structures using calculus and linear algebra,
- **[Differential topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology)** â€” focusing on properties of smooth manifolds that are invariant under diffeomorphisms, and
- **[Algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology)** â€” which uses algebraic tools to study topological spaces and continuous mappings.

I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics from [Sikkim University](https://cus.ac.in/), a central university established under an Act of Parliament, Government of India. I graduated with a **CGPA of 9.81** and received the **University Gold Medal**. My M.Sc. thesis, titled *"Nets & Filters in Topology"*, was carried out under the supervision of [Dr. Namita Behera](https://cus.ac.in/index.php/en/schools-e/physical-sciences/mathematics-dept/dr-namita-behera-2).

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy teaching, academic outreach, and writing. I am the author of the book *Beyond Answers: Beauty of Mathematical Questions*, available on Amazon and Notion Press.  
I regularly participate in Olympiad training camps, lecture series, and workshops to promote mathematics among students.

In my spare time, I engage with writing, web customization, and exploring educational tools. You can find my **talks and presentations** (some with slides) [here](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/ujjal-timshina/about).

For me, research is a quiet and deliberate journey into abstractionâ€”an exploration shaped not only by logic but also by creativity, persistence, and a willingness to embrace uncertainty. I view mathematics as both a tool for discovering truth and a language of elegant expression.  
I see research not as the pursuit of immediate answers, but as a recursive process: definitions evolve, intuitions are tested, and understanding emergesâ€”**layer by layer**â€”through reflection and refinement.

Above all, I believe research is sustained by **patience**, **humility**, and **wonder**. It is in revisiting ideasâ€”not in repetition, but in renewalâ€”that true insight begins to take form.

> *"To think deeply is to return continuously, never in repetition, but in renewal."*

> *"Lifelong learning is not a path you walk to a destination â€”  
it is the path that keeps you moving, growing, and discovering who you truly are.  
We forget, falter, and return â€” not in failure, but in pursuit.  
For in the recursive rhythm of thought,  
understanding does not appear fully formed,  
but emerges â€” layer by layer â€” through the patient erosion of illusion."*

In this post, we explore a fundamental result in **non-Euclidean geometry**, particularly **spherical geometry**, where the sum of the angles in a triangle **exceeds** \( \pi \) (180°). This deviation from Euclidean intuition leads to the concept of **angular excess**, and culminates in a beautiful theorem due to **Thomas Harriot**.

## Parallel Axiom and Non-Euclidean Geometry

The **Parallel Postulate** in Euclidean geometry is equivalent to the statement:

> The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is exactly \( \pi \).

When this postulate is dropped, we enter the realm of **non-Euclidean geometries**. There are two types:

- **Hyperbolic geometry** (non-Euclidean of the first kind), where the angle sum of a triangle is **less than** \( \pi \).
- **Spherical geometry** (non-Euclidean of the second kind), where the angle sum is **greater than** \( \pi \).

Euclid's original formulation of the parallel postulate is:

> Given a line \( L \) and a point \( P \notin L \), there is **exactly one line** through \( P \) that is parallel to \( L \).

Removing this condition leads to two possibilities:

- **More than one** line through \( P \) parallel to \( L \): hyperbolic geometry.
- **No line** through \( P \) parallel to \( L \): spherical geometry.

## Angular Excess in Spherical Geometry

Let us consider a sphere of radius \( R \). Its surface area is:

\[
\text{Area} = 4\pi R^2.
\]

Given **three distinct points** on the sphere, we can always join them by **arcs of great circles**, forming a **spherical triangle**.

### A Simple Example

Take one point at the **North Pole**, and two points on the **equator** separated by 90°. Connecting these three using great circles, we form a triangle with two **right angles** at the equator, and an angle \( \theta \) at the pole.

#### Illustration:

*Another depiction of a spherical triangle — angles sum to more than \( \pi \)*

In this example:

\[
\text{Angle sum} = \theta + \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2} = \theta + \pi.
\]

So the **angular excess** is:

\[
E = \theta.
\]

Let us now compute the **area** of this triangle. Since it occupies a fraction \( \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \) of the **northern hemisphere**, its area is:

\[
A = \left( \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \right)(2\pi R^2) = \theta R^2.
\]

Thus, we get the remarkable identity:

\[
E = \frac{A}{R^2}.
\]

## Thomas Harriot’s Theorem (1603)

This relation holds **for any triangle on the sphere**, not just the special case above. Harriot’s ingenious geometric argument shows this.

### Sketch of Harriot’s Proof

1. Extend the triangle's sides along great circles.
2. These divide the sphere into **8 spherical triangles**, four of which (your original \( \Delta \), plus \( \Delta_\alpha, \Delta_\beta, \Delta_\gamma \)) are congruent to their antipodal counterparts.
3. The total area of the sphere is \( 4\pi R^2 \).
4. By comparing the **wedges** formed by these triangles, Harriot deduced:

\[
A(\Delta) = R^2 (\alpha + \beta + \gamma - \pi) = R^2 E.
\]

## Conclusion

This formula links **geometry to area** in an elegant way:

\[
\boxed{A(\Delta) = R^2 \cdot E}
\]

It demonstrates that **curvature** influences geometry in a very tangible way: on a **positively curved surface** (like a sphere), the sum of the angles in a triangle grows **beyond** \( \pi \), and that growth is exactly proportional to the triangle’s area.

This geometric insight laid the groundwork for modern **differential geometry** and **general relativity**, where curvature controls not just triangle angle sums—but the very fabric of space and time.

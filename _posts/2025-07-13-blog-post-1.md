**This post is a personal reflection on the fading role of geometric intuition in modern mathematics, and a tribute to the visionaries who shaped how we understand space.**

When I began my Master’s studies at Sikkim University, I carried with me a quiet excitement. Among the courses on offer, there was one that drew me in more than the others: *Differential Geometry*. The very name sounded beautiful. I imagined that it would open doors to a world of curves and surfaces, of shapes bending and stretching in ways that gave physical meaning to abstract thought. I pictured elegant diagrams and smooth transitions from the flat spaces I knew to realms of flowing form. 

But what I encountered instead was surprisingly cold. The subject had become a machine — filled with symbols and formulas, precise but lifeless. My professor, with a kind of pride, called them “Luigi formulas” — long, complicated expressions built from derivatives and matrices and tensors. They were technically impressive, but I felt lost. The pictures, when they appeared in the textbook, were polished but sterile. They didn’t explain; they merely existed, like museum artifacts behind glass. There was no story, no intuition, no guiding light.

In class, I would sit quietly, trying to imagine the shapes behind the symbols. I kept asking myself: where has the geometry gone? Why did a subject that once dealt with lines and circles and curves now feel like a field of code?

Later, I stumbled upon a quote from Sir Michael Atiyah that stayed with me. He wrote, “Algebra is the offer made by the devil to the mathematician. ‘I’ll give you this powerful machine that answers any question you like,’ says the devil. ‘All you need to do is give me your soul — surrender your geometric intuition, and the marvelous machine is yours.’” That line felt like it was written for students like me. I realized then that much of modern mathematics had taken the devil’s deal. It had gained a language of great power, but had lost the imagination that once made it breathe.

Geometry, in its essence, is visual thought. It’s about space, form, and relation. Long before the rise of abstract symbols, humans understood space by seeing it and feeling it. They scratched triangles in the sand, followed the arcs of stars, built temples aligned with the solstices. They didn’t need algebra to know that shapes mattered.

One of the oldest and most famous examples is the equation 3² + 4² = 5². On the surface, it’s arithmetic. But what it really shows is the structure of space. If you draw a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4, the hypotenuse will be 5. This isn’t just a trick — it’s a visual truth. The Babylonians knew about such triples thousands of years ago. A clay tablet from around 1800 BCE, called Plimpton 322, lists large Pythagorean triples, like 13500² + 12709² = 18541². These are not numbers one guesses. They were found through careful thought — a kind of geometry that lived in numbers, long before formal proof.

Centuries later, Euclid in 300 BCE gathered the knowledge of his time and organized it into a book called *The Elements*. He didn’t just list facts. He built a logical world, starting from a few simple ideas. His first four axioms were straightforward: a line can be drawn between any two points, a line can be extended, a circle can be drawn with any center and radius, and all right angles are equal. These felt natural. They were the grammar of space.

But the fifth axiom — the parallel postulate — was strange. It stated that given a line and a point not on it, there is exactly one line through that point that never meets the original. It didn’t feel as obvious. Mathematicians wondered for centuries whether it could be proven from the others. They tried to avoid it, rewrite it, or explain it away. But it always returned, stubborn and mysterious.

Then came a bold idea. What if the fifth axiom simply wasn’t true?

In the early 1800s, two brilliant thinkers — Nikolai Lobachevsky in Russia and János Bolyai in Hungary — asked what would happen if more than one parallel could pass through that point. What they discovered was a new kind of geometry, now called hyperbolic. In this world, triangles have angles that add up to less than 180 degrees. Parallels multiply. Rectangles are impossible. Space feels stretched and open.

Later, another form of geometry emerged — spherical geometry — where lines are great circles, like the equator or the meridians on a globe. In this world, all lines eventually meet, and triangle angles add up to more than 180 degrees. There are no true parallels, and the rules are completely different from those of a flat plane.

These discoveries were more than clever tricks. They showed that space could be imagined in many ways — that the universe didn’t have to obey the rules of Euclid. And they weren’t just abstract. In time, they became essential to physics. Einstein’s theory of general relativity relies on the idea that space and time can curve. Gravity, in his view, is not a force but a feature of geometry. The orbits of planets, the bending of light, even the function of GPS satellites — all depend on non-Euclidean geometry.

But for those who made these discoveries, the path was not easy. When Bolyai sent his work to the great mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, hoping for praise, he received a crushing reply. Gauss told him that he had already discovered the same results, years earlier, but had never published them. To Bolyai, this was devastating. He had worked in isolation, built a new world from the ground up, and now it felt like that world had already been quietly claimed. He wrote that he had created a new universe “out of nothing.” But the silence that followed was too much. He withdrew from mathematics, and never returned to the work that had once filled him with fire.

Even so, the world he built endured.

Today, geometry lives in physics, in architecture, in art, in computer graphics, in robotics. When a spacecraft navigates the curved space near a planet, or a video game simulates a realistic 3D world, it is geometry at work. The old intuition still matters, even if we sometimes forget it.

And that, really, is the heart of this lament. In our pursuit of precision, we have let go of vision. We have tools of great power, but too often we no longer see what those tools are building. Students are taught formulas, but not the dreams that led to them. We are told to master the syntax, but not the story.

This is not a call to reject formal mathematics. We need rigor. We need symbols. But we also need the pictures that live beneath them — the curves we can imagine, the surfaces we can feel, the spaces we can explore in our minds. We need to remember that mathematics began not just in logic, but in wonder. In the shape of the moon, in the rise of a hill, in the triangle drawn with a stick in the sand.

Geometry is not dead. But it is sleeping.

Let us wake it up. Let us teach it not only as proof, but as poetry.

Let us remember the beauty that once made space feel alive.

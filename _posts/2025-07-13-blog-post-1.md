**This post is a personal reflection on the fading role of geometric intuition in modern mathematics, and a tribute to the visionaries who shaped how we understand space.**

When I began my Master’s studies at Sikkim University, I carried with me a quiet excitement. Among the courses on offer, there was one that drew me in more than the others: *Differential Geometry*. The very name sounded beautiful. I imagined that it would open doors to a world of curves and surfaces, of shapes bending and stretching in ways that gave physical meaning to abstract thought. I pictured elegant diagrams and smooth transitions from the flat spaces I knew to realms of flowing form. 

But what I encountered instead was surprisingly cold. The subject had become a machine — filled with symbols and formulas, precise but lifeless. My professor, with a kind of pride, called them “Luigi formulas” — long, complicated expressions built from derivatives and matrices and tensors. They were technically impressive, but I felt lost. The pictures, when they appeared in the textbook, were polished but sterile. They didn’t explain; they merely existed, like museum artifacts behind glass. There was no story, no intuition, no guiding light.

In class, I would sit quietly, trying to imagine the shapes behind the symbols. I kept asking myself: where has the geometry gone? Why did a subject that once dealt with lines and circles and curves now feel like a field of code?


# Differential Geometry: From Flat Space to Curved Worlds

Differential geometry is the study of curved spaces using calculus. But before there were curves, there was the flat plane—a world so familiar that we almost forget how strange it is.

Start with something simple: a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5. You've probably heard of the Pythagorean Theorem:

- 3² + 4² = 5²

This isn't just arithmetic—it reflects a fundamental property of right-angled triangles on a flat surface. Thousands of years ago, the Babylonians already knew larger versions of these relationships, like:

- 13500² + 12709² = 18541²

This was no accident. These numbers came from a way of understanding space—a kind of geometry that matched what we now call "Euclidean."

Geometry as a logical system began with Thales, and reached its peak with Euclid around 300 BCE. Euclid started with five assumptions and derived everything else. The fifth assumption, the “Parallel Postulate,” was the odd one out. It claimed:

- Through a point not on a line, there is exactly one line parallel to it.

Unlike the others, this one didn’t feel obviously true. Mathematicians spent 2,000 years trying to prove it from the others, but always failed. They found equivalents—for example, that triangle angles always sum to 180°—but these were just restatements, not proofs.

In the 1800s, mathematicians like Nikolai Lobachevsky and János Bolyai tried something radical: what if the Parallel Postulate was simply false? What if there could be more than one parallel line through a point? From that idea came hyperbolic geometry.

In this new geometry:

- More than one line can be drawn through a point that never meets the original line.
- Triangle angles add up to less than 180°.
- Rectangles don’t exist.

Others had come close. Saccheri and Lambert tried to deny the Postulate and hoped to find contradictions. They didn’t. Lambert even discovered that in this new world, triangles had angle sums less than 180°, but he stopped short. Lobachevsky and Bolyai, however, embraced it. They realized this was not a mistake—it was a valid, consistent geometry.

There was also spherical geometry, long known to navigators and astronomers. On a sphere, the “straight lines” are great circles like the equator or longitude lines. Here:

- All “straight” lines eventually intersect.
- Triangle angles add up to more than 180°.
- Parallel lines don’t exist.

Still, people thought of this as a special case of 3D geometry, not a fully alternative system.

Then came the breakthrough. In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami showed that hyperbolic geometry could be modeled on certain curved surfaces. Suddenly, it wasn’t just theoretical—it was real. Henri Poincaré and others then applied these ideas to physics, complex numbers, and topology.

Differential geometry was born out of this evolution. It unites calculus and geometry to describe curvature precisely. It’s essential to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, where gravity isn’t a force but the bending of spacetime.

But there is a human story too. When Bolyai sent his work to Carl Friedrich Gauss, the greatest mathematician of the time, Gauss replied:

- “To praise your work would be to praise myself. I discovered it long ago.”

Bolyai was devastated. He withdrew from mathematics forever.

Today, non-Euclidean geometry underpins GPS, computer graphics, robotics, cosmology, and more. But we must be careful. When we strip away the meaning, and teach only symbols and logic, we lose what made it powerful in the first place.

Differential geometry is not just a set of formulas. It’s a story about how people tried to understand the shape of the world. From a child drawing lines in sand to physicists describing black holes, it’s all part of one long, unfolding narrative.

Let’s teach it that way. Let’s start not with definitions, but with the wonder of space itself.

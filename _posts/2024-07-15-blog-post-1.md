This post explores **Thomas Harriotâ€™s Theorem** in the setting of spherical geometry, highlighting the link between angular excess and the area of a spherical triangle. While a simple overview is presented here, the complete **visual proof** is detailed in the document above.

I also attempted to create animations for better intuition, though they didnâ€™t succeed as intended â€” the spirit of that effort is still visible in the linked material. This is a compact yet rich exploration into the geometry of curved surfaces.

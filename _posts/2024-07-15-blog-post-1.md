This post gives a brief yet insightful look into **Thomas Harriot‚Äôs Theorem**, which relates the **angular excess** of a spherical triangle to its **surface area** ‚Äî a cornerstone idea in **spherical** and **non-Euclidean geometry**.

While the key idea is kept simple here, the attached document provides a **complete visual and geometric proof** for deeper exploration.

This short write-up explores **Thomas Harriotâ€™s geometric insights** on spherical triangles, particularly the relation between angular excess and area. By linking classical geometry with curvature on the sphere, it illustrates how a spherical triangleâ€™s area is proportional to its angle sum exceeding 180Â°, a cornerstone idea in non-Euclidean geometry.

This document contains visual intuition, clean derivations, and accessible exposition â€” aimed at those interested in classical results with geometric depth.

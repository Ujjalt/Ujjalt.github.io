This post offers a concise insight into **Thomas Harriotâ€™s Theorem**, connecting the angular excess of spherical triangles to their surface area â€” a foundational result in spherical and non-Euclidean geometry. While the core idea is kept simple here, the attached document includes a **complete visual and geometric proof**.

I attempted to develop animations to enhance the intuition, though couldnâ€™t successfully render them. For visual clarity, the linked document refers to an external **video created by a third party**. Full credit for that video goes to its original creator â€” it is included purely for educational and illustrative purposes under fair use.

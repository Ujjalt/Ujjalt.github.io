This note explores a classical result in spherical geometry, where the sum of angles in a triangle exceeds that of flat geometry. It introduces the concept of angular excess and explains how it relates to the area of a triangle drawn on a sphere.

Originally discovered by Thomas Harriot in the early 1600s, the theorem provides a striking link between angle sum and surface area.
